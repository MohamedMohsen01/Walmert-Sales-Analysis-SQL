# Walmart Sales Data Analysis



## Project Description

This SQL project aims to utilize the Walmart Sales data to gain insights into various aspects, including top-performing branches and products, sales trends across different products, and customer behavior. The primary objective is to analyze the data using SQL queries and identify opportunities for improving and optimizing sales strategies.

## Project Goals

Identify top-performing branches: Utilize SQL queries to analyze sales data and determine the branches that consistently achieve high sales volumes. Identify key factors contributing to their success, such as location, customer demographics, or specific product offerings.

Analyze best-selling products: Explore the data to identify the best-selling products in Walmart stores. Use SQL queries to determine the products with the highest sales volumes or revenues. Analyze factors like product category, price range, or promotional activities to understand the drivers of their success.

Study sales trends: Use SQL queries to analyze historical sales data and uncover trends and patterns associated with different product categories. Identify seasonal variations, sales spikes, or other factors that impact sales performance. Visualize the trends using charts or graphs to aid in understanding and decision-making.

Understand customer behavior: Analyze customer purchase patterns and behaviors by querying the data. Extract insights into customer demographics, purchase frequency, preferred products, or shopping habits. Use SQL queries to segment customers and identify opportunities for targeted marketing and personalized promotions.

Improve sales strategies: Based on the analysis of the Walmart Sales data, propose actionable recommendations for enhancing sales strategies. Utilize SQL queries to identify areas for optimization, such as inventory management, pricing strategies, or promotional campaigns. Provide data-backed insights to help optimize sales and drive business growth.

## Approach Used

1. **Data Wrangling:** This is the first step where inspection of data is done to make sure **NULL** values and missing values are detected and data replacement methods are used to replace, missing or **NULL** values.

> 1. Build a database
> 2. Create table and insert the data.
> 3. Select columns with null values in them. There are no null values in our database as in creating the tables, we set **NOT NULL** for each field, hence null values are filtered out.

2. **Feature Engineering:** This will help use generate some new columns from existing ones.

> 1. Add a new column named `time_of_day` to give insight of sales in the Morning, Afternoon and Evening. This will help answer the question on which part of the day most sales are made.

> 2. Add a new column named `day_name` that contains the extracted days of the week on which the given transaction took place (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri). This will help answer the question on which week of the day each branch is busiest.

> 3. Add a new column named `month_name` that contains the extracted months of the year on which the given transaction took place (Jan, Feb, Mar). Help determine which month of the year has the most sales and profit.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploratory data analysis is done to answer the listed questions and aims of this project.

3. **Conclusion:**

## Revenue And Profit Calculations

$ COGS = unitsPrice * quantity $

$ VAT = 5\% * COGS $

$VAT$ is added to the $COGS$ and this is what is billed to the customer.

$ total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS $

$ grossProfit(grossIncome) = total(gross_sales) - COGS $

**Gross Margin** is gross profit expressed in percentage of the total(gross profit/revenue)

$ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}} $

<u>**Example with the first row in our DB:**</u>

**Data given:**

- $ \text{Unite Price} = 45.79 $
- $ \text{Quantity} = 7 $

$ COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53 $

$ \text{VAT} = 5\% * COGS\\= 5\%  320.53 = 16.0265 $

$ total = VAT + COGS\\= 16.0265 + 320.53 = $336.5565$

$ \text{Gross Margin Percentage} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}}\\=\frac{16.0265}{336.5565} = 0.047619\\\approx 4.7619\% $
